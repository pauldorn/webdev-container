# webdev-container
Dockerized WebStorm and CLion (Requires license, not provided. 30 day trial)

My teams are not allowed to install NodeJS on bare metal to force use of Docker for development.
This tool is meant to automate building a friendly environment to run Webstorm or CLion in docker.

## Install
Download WebStorm-VERSION.tar.gz
and
clion-VERSION-tar.gz
from the appropriate IntelliJ website.
